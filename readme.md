* Sample in /sample folder
* http://coolwanglu.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/
* https://github.com/fagbokforlaget/pdftohtmljs
* https://pdf2htmlex.blogspot.co.uk
* https://gist.github.com/maxogden/5842859

In the wilds of .org these would need to be extracted and displayed initially on the pages below through if possible looking for and converting the first listed PDF URL in the select box or if single language the the PDF linked to in the button.  It would need to happen during the page load process without excessive delay.  (UA's are quite small files)
